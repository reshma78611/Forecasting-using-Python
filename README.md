# Forecasting

Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.

## Forecasting methods:-

1)	If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then qualitative forecasting methods must be used.
2)	Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:\
      a)	numerical information about the past is available\
      b)	it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
      
## Forecasting model building methods:-
1)	Linear model
2)	Exponential model
3)	Quadratic model
4)	Additive seasonality 
5)	Additive seasonality with quadratic trend	
6)	Multiplicative Seasonality


## Data Used :
              Airlines dataset :- Forecast the passengers in the airlines depending on past and present data
              Coca cola sales raw dataset : Forecast cococola sales depending on past and present data
              Plastic sales dataset : Forecast sales of plastic depending on past and present data
              Amtrak dataset: Forecast Ridership depending on past and present data
              Footfalls: Forecast the number of foot falls depending on past and present data
              
## Programming:- 
                  Python
